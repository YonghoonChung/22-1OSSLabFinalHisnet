## Why is this project useful?
- During this semester, I realized that several people irresponsibly booked the conference room and did not show up. This leads to the waste of materials. I wondered how to solve this issue, then the answer did not popped up. What about we let the other people to just use this room after getting permission. Therefore this program has came out.
- I thought it will be great if someone tells me the name and phone number of the booker, then I might be able to take an action on whether to use this room for a few minutes.
- This project is very useful to everyone. By using this program, student can find better place and efficient way of using the conference room. Also this program also indicates the empty room at the time. Without using this program, a person had to visit every page of conference room whether the room is empty or not. However, by waiting until the program is getting ready, the user can easily find which room is empty and which room is shouldn't be empty.
